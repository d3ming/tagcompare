There are many differences and issues when trying to render an HTML5 creative under different platform/browsers.
  1. Fonts might look or **be** different
  2. CSS / layout differences
  3. Animation / timing differences

This tool tries to address the first 2 points above by doing image comparison of an HTML5 creative tag under different 
platform/browser configurations

## Setup
`make install` to install dependencies

### settings.json
Make a local copy of [`settings.json`](tagcompare/settings.json) called `settings.local.json`
Update the values for webdriver user/key and placelocal secret:
```json
  "webdriver": {
    "user": "USER",
    "key": "KEY",
    "url": "REMOTE_WEBDRIVER_URL"
  },
  "placelocal": {
    "domain": "www.placelocaldemo.com",
    "secret": {
      "pl-secret": "SECRET",
      "pl-service-identifier": "SERVICEID"
    }
  }
```

## Running the tool
`make run` will run the tool to capture screenshots and compare them
  - `make capture` will run a new capture images job
  - `make compare` will compare existing output, given a list of campaigns and configs

All outputs generated by the tool will be stored in `/tmp/tagcompare`

## Running tests
`make test` or `tox` will run unit tests
